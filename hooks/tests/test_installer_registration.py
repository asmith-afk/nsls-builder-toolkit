"""install.sh must register hook commands that can actually run.

Plain stdlib, no pytest: run with `python3 hooks/tests/test_installer_registration.py`.

The failure this exists to prevent, found 2026-09-20 on origin/main. The
installer writes settings.json from a Python program embedded in a shell
double-quoted string (`python3 -c "..."`). The guardrail gate's command was
built with unescaped double quotes, which closed that shell string early — so
the shell executed fragments of the Python source as words, and settings.json
received the literal text:

    python3  + os.path.join(CONFIG_DIR, local-plugins/.../guardrail-gate.py) +

as the hook command. It is not runnable. The gate therefore could not have
fired on any Mac the installer touched, even before the migration deleted the
entry, and every matching tool call would have printed a hook-error notice. The
session-start entry a few lines above escapes its quotes correctly; nobody
compared them, because nothing executed the installer's output.

This runs the real block from the real install.sh against a throwaway config
dir and then runs what it wrote.
